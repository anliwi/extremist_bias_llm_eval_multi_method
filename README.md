## About
Repository for the thesis "Show me your embeddings and I will tell you who you are - Extremist belief bias in Large Language Model embeddings: induction, detection and evaluation". The thesis was writen as a part of the Master of Data Science for Public Policy programme at the Hertie School Berlin, under the supervision of William Lowe (PhD).

## Overview

## Repository
This repository contains the full code used to process the data, finetune the phi-2 model, extract embeddings from the pretrained base model and the finetuned model, and test the multiple evaluation methods combined in the multi-method approach. The multi-method approach includes visualization of the embeddings on tensorboard using PCA and t-sne which can be used to run interactive visualizations by the viewer of this repository.
